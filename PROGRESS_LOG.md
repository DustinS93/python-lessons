## Session 1 — 2026-06-04

### What We Covered
- `print` vs `return` — print displays to screen, return hands a value back to the caller
- Parameters vs arguments — parameters are placeholders in the definition, arguments are values passed at call time
- Default parameters — must come after parameters without defaults; used as fallback when no argument is passed
- Passing multiple arguments to a function
- String concatenation inside return statements (spacing matters)

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/describe_pet.py` — function that takes `name` and optional `animal` (default: "dog"), returns a sentence

### Vocabulary Introduced
- parameter
- argument
- default parameter
- return value

### What He Struggled With
- Passing string arguments (passed bare words instead of quoted strings — "not defined" error)
- Default parameter syntax — initially set the default as a variable outside the function instead of inside the `def` line
- String spacing in concatenation

### What Felt Solid
- `print` vs `return` distinction clicked quickly
- Understood why default parameters must come after non-default ones unprompted
- Read and interpreted error messages himself before asking

### Notes for Next Session
- Cover passing multiple arguments explicitly in drills before the puzzle — Dustin flagged this was missing this session
- He's self-aware about gaps, good instinct for debugging
- Pick up with: more function practice or introduce scope (local vs global variables)

---

## Session 2 — 2026-06-04

### What We Covered
- Type conversion drills: `str()`, `int()`, `float()`
- `int("7.5")` raises ValueError — must go `float()` first, then `int()`
- `int()` truncates, does not round
- Why `"string" + 42` fails — can't concatenate str and int
- REPL "print" explained — the P in REPL, not Python's `print()`
- Functions calling functions with type conversion in the return string

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/temp_converter.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- truncation
- REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop)

### What He Struggled With
- Minor: typo and missing " F" in format string — caught on review

### What Felt Solid
- Type conversion drills — got `int(float("7.5"))` unprompted
- Recognized why `str()` was needed without being told
- Connected REPL behavior to the acronym himself

### Notes for Next Session
- Type conversion is solid — ready to move on
- Next: introduce scope (local vs global variables), or conditional logic (`if`/`else`)

---

## Session 3 — 2026-06-04

### What We Covered
- Conditionals: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- `>` vs `>=` — strictly greater than vs greater than or equal
- Python checks conditions top to bottom and stops at first true match
- No output when condition is false and no `else` — not an error
- Applied `str()` in a puzzle without being prompted

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/grade_checker.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- conditional
- `elif`

### What He Struggled With
- Nothing significant — thought through the two-function design himself before writing

### What Felt Solid
- `if`/`elif`/`else` structure clicked immediately
- Reasoned through passing a return value as an argument unprompted
- Used `str()` correctly without a reminder

### Notes for Next Session
- Conditionals are solid
- Next: scope (local vs global variables) OR introduce `input()` to make programs interactive

---

## Session 4 — 2026-06-05

### What We Covered
- `input()` — prompts user, pauses program, returns a string
- `input()` always returns a string even if user types a number
- `int(input())` — wrapping input to convert at the source
- Redundant conditions in `elif` — if first `if` fails, later conditions are already implied
- Converting once vs converting repeatedly inside conditionals

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/ticket_price.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- (none new)

### What He Struggled With
- Tried to convert in the parameter definition — good instinct, wrong place

### What Felt Solid
- Knew immediately that `input()` returns a string
- Recognized the redundant `>= 13` check himself
- Figured out `int(input())` pattern on his own

### Where to Start Next Session
- `input()` is solid
- Next: scope (local vs global variables)

---

## Session 5 — 2026-06-05

### What We Covered
- Scope: local vs global variables
- Local variables only exist inside the function where they're defined
- Global variables are visible everywhere, including inside functions
- Same variable name in two scopes — function uses its own local copy
- Function definition order doesn't matter, only call order does
- `return` vs `print` inside functions — return hands a value back, print just displays

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/the_vault.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- scope
- local scope
- global scope

### What He Struggled With
- Initially used `print` inside function + `print(lock())` outside — got `None`, reasoned through it himself

### What Felt Solid
- Immediately understood why `NameError` appeared when accessing local variable outside function
- Correctly predicted global variable accessible inside function
- Understood `return` vs `print` distinction quickly once he saw the `None`

### Where to Start Next Session
- Scope is solid
- Next: `global` keyword OR lists/loops revisit OR introduce more complex function patterns

---

## Session 6 — 2026-06-05

### What We Covered
- Lists: creating, indexing with `[0]`, `[-1]`, `len()`
- Negative indexing — `-1` is always the last item
- `for item in list` loop — loop variable is a temporary name, can be anything
- Loop counter pattern — variable before loop, increment inside loop
- `return` inside a loop exits the entire function immediately
- Parameter names are arbitrary — what matters is consistency inside the function

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/the_shopping_list.py`
- `puzzles/the_countdown.py`
- `puzzles/the_grade_book.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- index
- negative index

### What He Struggled With
- `number = +1` vs `number = number + 1` — subtle distinction, caught himself
- Hardcoded counter instead of `len()` — corrected when prompted
- Initially used `return` inside loop — understood why it was wrong once reminded what `return` does

### What Felt Solid
- Loop variable naming clicked immediately — tested it himself
- Combining loops with conditionals in `the_grade_book.py` — wrote it cleanly
- Knew when to drop `print()` wrapper vs when to use `return`

### Where to Start Next Session
- Lists and loops are solid
- Next: list methods (`append`, `remove`, etc.) OR introduce `while` loops OR step up puzzle complexity

---

## Session 7 — 2026-06-06

### What We Covered
- Keyword arguments — passing arguments by name, order doesn't matter
- `while` loops — run based on a condition, not a fixed list
- Infinite loops — what causes them and how to avoid (must update the condition inside the loop)
- Code after a `while` block runs once when the loop ends
- Converting `int()` once at the call site instead of repeatedly inside the function

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/while_countdown.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- keyword argument

### What He Struggled With
- `return` inside a loop again — caught it with a nudge back to prior puzzles
- Tried putting `int()` in the `def` line — clarified that parameter names must be plain names
- Placed `print("Blast Off!")` outside the function initially — understood indentation fix quickly

### What Felt Solid
- Guessed infinite loop correctly without running it
- Understood why condition is checked before the loop body runs
- Converted `int()` once at call site once pointed in the right direction

### Where to Start Next Session
- `while` loops solid
- Next: list methods (`append`, `remove`, `pop`, `in`) OR a harder puzzle combining while + lists

---

## Session 8 — 2026-06-07

### What We Covered
- List methods: `append`, `pop`, `remove`, `in`
- `pop()` removes and returns the last item — return value can be caught in a variable
- `remove(item)` removes by value, not by index
- `in` returns a boolean — no need for `== True`
- `return` inside a loop exits the entire function — "not found" return goes outside the loop
- `for...else` is valid Python but not the intended pattern — cleaner without `else`
- `input()` inside a `def` line runs at definition time, not call time (recurring)
- Hardcode starter data when a puzzle needs a populated list — don't rely on `input()` for setup

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/grocery_cart.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- (none new)

### What He Struggled With
- `input()` placed inside `def` line again — same pattern as `int()` in sessions 4 and 7
- `if item in cart == True` — removed `== True` once reminded what `in` returns
- `item in i` vs `i == item` in find_item — flipped twice before correcting
- Cart population: "starts as empty list" without clear setup instructions caused confusion

### What Felt Solid
- Caught that `remove_last` was emptying the cart before `remove_item` ran
- Understood `pop()` returns the removed item after one nudge
- `return` outside the loop in `find_item` — got it right after the session-opening drill
- Explained all four methods accurately at session end

### Where to Start Next Session
- List methods solid
- Next: `while` loop + `append` to build a multi-item cart (natural follow-on from today)
- Surface `return` inside loop again — not yet eliminated (needs 2 consecutive clean appearances)

---

## Session 9 — 2026-06-08

### What We Covered
- `return` inside a loop — targeted drill, clarified it's not an `else` branch, just the next line in sequence after the loop finishes
- `while` loop + `append` + `input()` — wired together in a self-contained function
- Self-contained function: no parameters, creates its own data (`cart = []`, `item = input()`) internally
- Redundant `break` — while condition handles exit on its own

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/grocery_cart_v2.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- (none new)

### What He Struggled With
- `return` inside the loop again — placed it inside the while block before catching it when prompted with the drill connection
- Didn't know how to make a function self-contained — tried passing `cart` and `item` as parameters from outside
- `NameError` when removing parameters but not updating the function call

### What Felt Solid
- Connected `return` placement to the session-opening drill after being nudged
- Understood while loop exits naturally — no `break` needed
- Self-contained function concept explained clearly at session end

### Where to Start Next Session
- `return` inside loop: surfaced again (session 9) — still not eliminated, needs 2 consecutive clean unprompted appearances
- Next puzzle should surface `return` inside a loop again naturally
- Consider: dictionary basics OR `for` + `while` combination

---

## Session 10 — 2026-06-10

### What We Covered
- `return` inside a loop — targeted opening drill (3+ weak spots threshold)
- `for` + `while` combination — `while` inside `for`, controlling inner loop independently
- Initializing `answer = ""` before a while loop so it always runs at least once
- Dead code — line after `return` never executes
- Placement: what belongs inside while vs outside, and why

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/inventory_check.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- (none new)

### What He Struggled With
- Placement — figuring out what goes inside the while vs before it, and in what order (recurring weak spot)
- Quit logic: placed `if quit` before the while loop first — had to be guided to see it never triggered inside the loop

### What Felt Solid
- `return` exits the whole function even when nested inside two loops — stated correctly in drill and at session end
- `while answer != "yes"` — understood to check a value directly, not a bool flag
- Dead code — spotted immediately once pointed at it

### Where to Start Next Session
- `return` inside loop: surfaced in session 10 puzzle — needed guidance on structure, not yet eliminated
- Placement weak spot: confirmed again — design next puzzle to surface it
- Next concept: dictionary basics (was planned, got bumped — now properly drilled first before use)

---

## Session 11 — 2026-06-11

### What We Covered
- `return` inside a loop — targeted opening drill (3+ weak spots threshold)
- Dictionary basics: creating, accessing by key, adding keys, updating keys
- `KeyError` — accessing a key that doesn't exist
- `len()` on a dictionary
- `.keys()` — returns all keys in a dictionary
- Setting a variable before building a dictionary, then using it as a value

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/student_record.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- key
- value
- key-value pair

### What He Struggled With
- `==` vs `=` — used comparison instead of assignment inside `if` block
- Placement: put `return passed` inside the `if` block, exiting before the dictionary was built
- Hardcoded dictionary value instead of using the variable (`45` instead of `grade`)

### What Felt Solid
- `return` inside a loop drill — clean, explained correctly with no guidance
- Understood `passed` is just a variable — dictionary reads it, no return needed
- Spotted `==` vs `=` issue himself once prompted to look at the line
- Understood why lists use index and dictionaries use keys at session end

### Where to Start Next Session
- `return` inside loop: clean in opening drill — 1 of 2 consecutive clean appearances needed to eliminate
- Placement weak spot: surfaced again (return inside if block) — still recurring

---

## Session 12 — 2026-06-11

### What We Covered
- `return` inside a loop — opening drill, 2nd consecutive clean appearance (eliminated)
- `None` — Python's "nothing" value, always capital N. REPL suppresses it; `print()` shows it
- Case sensitivity — `None` vs `none`, Python distinguishes uppercase from lowercase everywhere
- `while True / break` — loops forever until `break` fires; use when no value exists to check at loop start
- `break` vs `return` — `break` exits the loop, `return` exits the entire function
- BUILD v0.1 — first working version of the shopping list app

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/menu_loop.py`
- `projects/shopping_list.py` (BUILD v0.1)

### Vocabulary Introduced
- `None`
- case-sensitive
- `break`

### What He Struggled With
- Used `return` instead of `break` in menu puzzle — needed reminder of the distinction
- REPL showing nothing for `None` return — confused about whether function ran

### What Felt Solid
- `while True` rationale — explained correctly that no condition exists yet at loop start
- `shopping_list = []` outside the loop — caught the reset problem when asked
- BUILD v0.1 structure clean — loop, list, append, numbered view, break on quit all correct

### Where to Start Next Session
- `return` inside loop: ELIMINATED — 2 consecutive clean appearances (sessions 11 and 12)
- Placement weak spot: still active — surfaced in menu puzzle (return vs break)
- Next: Step 13 — modifying list items `list[i] = value`, needed for marking items done (BUILD v0.2)

---

## Session 13 — 2026-06-12

### What We Covered
- List indexing review — `items[0]`, `items[-1]`, `len(items)` (opening drill, 2+ sessions ago)
- `list[i] = value` — modifying an item in place by index
- `"[x] " + items[i]` — prepending a string to mark an item done
- `int(input()) - 1` — converting 1-based user input to 0-based index
- Input validation — checking `choice < 1 or choice > len(items)` before updating
- `return` to exit early from a function on invalid input

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/mark_done.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- (none new)

### What He Struggled With
- Condition logic: used `and` instead of `or` for invalid range check
- Update ran before the validation check — order was backwards initially

### What Felt Solid
- Caught `input()` inside function was wrong (parameter should come from caller)
- Caught `print(print_list(...))` printing `None` himself
- Fixed `<= 1` to `< 1` after testing edge case himself
- Order issue (check before update) — caught it when prompted, not fully unprompted yet

### Where to Start Next Session
- Placement weak spot: still active — surfaced again (check after update), caught when prompted
- Next: Step 14 — storing a return value in a variable (`result = function()`), needed for BUILD v0.2
- After Step 14: BUILD v0.2 — mark items done in the shopping list app
- Next: dictionary puzzle with input() and updating keys, or add a second dictionary concept (e.g. iterating over keys)

---

## Session 14 — 2026-06-13

### What We Covered
- Opening REPL drill: `.pop()` removes and returns the last item — value can be caught in a variable
- `result = function()` — storing a return value before using it
- REPL drills: `double(result)`, `message = add_greeting()`, direct vs stored return value
- Validation placement — check belongs in main code, not inside a helper function
- Puzzle: two clean functions, store-then-validate-then-act pattern

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/name_badge.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- (none new)

### What He Struggled With
- Placement (x3 in one puzzle): validation inside `get_name()`, then `make_badge()` called before empty check, then `badge` stored outside the `else` block — each caught when prompted, none unprompted
- Recognized the tangling problem himself once asked about it (get_name returning "Name required", make_badge having to check for it)

### What Felt Solid
- REPL drills clicked fast — chained return values, doubled result, understood argument vs parameter unprompted
- Understood why two tangled functions is a problem once he saw it
- Final structure was clean: get → store → check → act

### Where to Start Next Session
- Placement weak spot: still very active — 3 separate placement mistakes in one puzzle (session 14), all caught when prompted
- Step 14 complete — both checkboxes done
- Next: BUILD v0.2 — mark items done in shopping list app

---

## Session 15 — 2026-06-14

### What We Covered
- Opening REPL drill: `list[i] = value` — modifying list items in place
- BUILD v0.2 confirmed complete — checked off in ROADMAP
- File I/O: `open()` modes (`"r"`, `"w"`, `"a"`), `with open() as f:`, `f.write()`, `f.read()`, `f.readlines()`, `.strip()`
- `\n` as escape sequence in code vs literal characters when typed as input
- Puzzle: `goal_saver.py` — write goal to file, read it back, return clean value
- `import os`, `os.path.exists()` — modules intro, what import does
- BUILD v0.3 complete — load from file on startup, save on quit

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/goal_saver.py`
- `projects/shopping_list.py` (BUILD v0.3 — complete project)

### Vocabulary Introduced
- (none new)

### What He Struggled With
- Placement: `input()` inside `save_goal()`, `print()` inside `load_goal()` — caught when prompted
- Placement: multiple iterations to get read block correct in BUILD v0.3 — loop direction backwards (looping over shopping_list instead of contents), and method confusion
- Asked sharp questions unprompted about modules vs file object methods — good instinct

### What Felt Solid
- File I/O concepts clicked in drills — explained `"r"` vs `"w"` correctly at session end
- `import` and module vs file object distinction — understood after one explanation
- App works end to end: add, view, mark done, persist across runs
- Recognised `\n` vs typed `\n` after seeing the file contents

### Where to Start Next Session
- Placement weak spot: persistent — multiple errors across goal_saver and BUILD v0.3, all caught when prompted
- Project complete — CLI Shopping List Manager done, committed to GitHub
- ROADMAP stretch goals available: dictionaries refactor, error handling
- Or define a new roadmap project

---

## Session 16 — 2026-06-14

### What We Covered
- System compression: DRILLS.md restructured (Puzzle Index, Active Concepts, Ingrained), CLAUDE.md updated
- REPL drills: list of dicts, accessing dict fields in a loop, `.pop(index)`, `str.split(",")`, bool from string comparison (`parts[1] == "True"`)
- Dictionaries refactor of shopping_list.py — items stored as `{"name": ..., "done": False}` instead of plain strings
- Added delete item option using `.pop(index)`
- File format: save as `name,done` per line, reconstruct on load with `.split(",")` and string comparison

### Puzzles Completed
- (none — project refactor session)

### Vocabulary Introduced
- (none new)

### What He Struggled With
- Load block indentation — new lines ended up outside the for loop, required multiple saves to fix
- `.pop([remove_item - 1])` — extra square brackets around the argument (didn't clear on first fix)
- Bracket placement in save line — `str(item["done": + "\n"]))` — closing bracket in wrong place

### What Felt Solid
- List of dicts pattern clicked fast in drills
- Save format: wrote `item["name"] + "," + str(item["done"]) + "\n"` correctly on first try after guidance
- Key insight at session end: storing data vs. display strings — articulated correctly unprompted

### Where to Start Next Session
- Active concepts needing more reps: list of dicts, `.pop(index)`, `str.split()`, file format for structured data
- Placement weak spot: still active — indentation errors with load block this session
- Consider a standalone puzzle using list-of-dicts and `.pop(index)` before moving to error handling
- Or: error handling stretch goal (what if user types a letter instead of a number?)

---

## Session 17 — 2026-06-15

### What We Covered
- Opening REPL drill: dictionary basics — accessing, updating, adding keys, `.keys()`, `len()`
- `try/except ValueError` — catching errors from bad user input instead of crashing
- `not in range(len(list))` — checking for out-of-range input
- Why logic inside `try` block matters — anything after a failed line is skipped, variables never assigned

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/number_picker.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- (none new)

### What He Struggled With
- `if choice != 0 or 1 or 2` — thought this checked all three values; learned `or 1` is always truthy
- Placement: `choice = choice - 1` and conditionals initially outside `try` block — caught it himself mid-puzzle after NameError
- `try/except` explanation at session end was slightly incomplete — named the what but not the why on placement

### What Felt Solid
- Diagnosed NameError himself: "choice only gets assigned if the try block succeeds" — correct, unprompted
- Used `range(len(grocery_list))` independently — cleaner than a hardcoded list
- Simplified `if/elif` chain to `grocery_list[choice]` unprompted

### Where to Start Next Session
- Placement weak spot: surfaced again — but Dustin caught it himself this time (NameError → diagnosis → fix without being told). Progress.
- Next: error handling in shopping_list.py (apply try/except to the real project), or new puzzle concept
- `try/except` is new — worth one more puzzle before moving on

---

## Session 18 — 2026-06-16

### What We Covered
- Opening REPL drill: chaining return values — `result = function()`, passing return values as arguments
- `input_validator.py` — second `try/except ValueError` puzzle, range checking 1–10
- `IndexError` — raised when accessing a list index out of range
- Nested `try/except` — inner `except IndexError` inside outer `except ValueError`
- Applied error handling to `shopping_list.py` — both `ValueError` (bad menu input) and `IndexError` (out-of-range item selection)

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/input_validator.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- `IndexError`

### What He Struggled With
- Placed `if choice == 5:` inside `except IndexError` block — caught it after being pointed to the line numbers, not fully unprompted

### What Felt Solid
- Correct `except IndexError` syntax guessed unprompted from `ValueError` pattern
- Range check fix (`<= 10`) caught and applied himself
- Structural reasoning: knew choice 5 needed to be outside the inner try/except once spotted

### Where to Start Next Session
- Placement weak spot: surfaced again in shopping_list.py — caught after a hint, not unprompted. Still tracking.
- Start expense tracker roadmap: step 1 is `float`, nothing checked off yet
- After expense tracker, plan a Pygame or Tkinter roadmap (Dustin expressed interest)

## Session 19 — 2026-06-18

### What We Covered
- Opening REPL drill: list of dicts — looping, accessing fields (session 16 concept)
- f-strings — `f"{variable}"`, `f"{value:.2f}"` for fixed-point decimals
- `:.2f` format spec — always show 2 decimal places, dependent on f-string prefix
- `.capitalize()` — string method, first letter uppercase
- Passing dict values as separate arguments to a function
- Key insight: dict keys and function parameter names are separate things that can share the same spelling

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/receipt_printer.py`
- `puzzles/menu_board.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- `.capitalize()`

### What He Struggled With
- `receipt_printer.py`: used `e["desc"]` inside function instead of parameters — function was ignoring its own arguments, reading global `e`
- Confusion between dict keys, parameter names, and loop access when all have similar names ("inception" effect)
- Needed redirect to separate the loop from the function (loop inside function vs loop calling function)

### What Felt Solid
- `:.2f` clicked after one explanation and drills
- Correctly identified that `.capitalize()` can't be called on a float
- `menu_board.py`: header placed outside the loop unprompted — first clean placement appearance this session
- Articulated parameter passing correctly in plain English at end of session

### Where to Start Next Session
- Placement weak spot: first clean unprompted appearance (menu_board.py header). One more needed to eliminate.
- Next: Step 4 — summing values from a list of dicts (REPL drill first)
- Design next puzzle to surface placement weak spot again

## Session 20 — 2026-06-18

### What We Covered
- Opening REPL drill: list of dicts field access (session 16/17 concept)
- Accumulator pattern — `total = 0`, loop, `total = total + item["field"]`
- Grouping and accumulating — dict of totals, `totals[e["category"]] = totals[e["category"]] + e["amount"]`
- Looping over `dict.keys()` to print formatted output with `:.2f` and `.capitalize()`

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/score_total.py`
- `puzzles/category_totals.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- accumulator pattern

### What He Struggled With
- `category_totals.py`: placed f-string as a dict key — `e[f"{amount:.2f}"]` — caught quickly when explained
- Needed an extra REPL pass on the grouping pattern before the puzzle

### What Felt Solid
- Accumulator pattern clicked fast — drilled twice, wrote loop independently on second pass
- Explained `totals[e["category"]]` lookup correctly unprompted
- Applied `.capitalize()` and `:.2f` in `category_totals.py` without being prompted
- Wrote grouping loop from scratch without reference to the drilled version

### Where to Start Next Session
- Placement weak spot: no structural placement test this session — status unchanged (1/2 clean appearances needed to eliminate)
- Steps 4 and 5 complete — next: BUILD v0.1 of expense tracker
- Design the build step to surface placement weak spot (header, totals label, menu — all have placement decisions)

---

## Session 21 — 2026-06-19

### What We Covered
- Opening REPL drill: f-strings with `:.2f` (session 17 concept)
- `key not in dict` — checking before adding a new key to avoid KeyError
- BUILD v0.1 of expense tracker — full working core, no file saving

### Puzzles Completed
- `projects/expense_tracker.py` (BUILD v0.1)

### Vocabulary Introduced
- (none new)

### What He Struggled With
- Placed `expenses = []` inside the `while True` loop — needed a prompt to catch it (placement streak reset to 0)
- `!= in` — tried to combine operators instead of using `not in`
- `total.append()` — used list method on a dict; needed redirect to DRILLS.md

### What Felt Solid
- Caught that `category_totals.py` was hardcoded — good observation
- Understood `not in` quickly once the drill was done
- Explained final concept back correctly: initializing the key to 0 so the add line always has something to work with
- `float` fix identified immediately when asked

### Where to Start Next Session
- Placement weak spot: streak at 0 — placed `expenses = []` inside loop, needed a hint
- Next: Step 6 — saving and loading a list of dicts to/from a file

---

## Session 22 — 2026-06-22

### What We Covered
- Opening REPL drill: grouping/accumulating with `dict.keys()` and `:.2f` (session 19/20 concept)
- File I/O REPL pass 1: saving a list of dicts to file — comma-separated values, `\n`, only values written
- File I/O REPL pass 2: `os.path.exists()` wrapping the load block, `return []` fallback
- Full round-trip: save → file → load → list of dicts with correct types
- `result = load_movies()` — storing a function's return value
- f-string single quotes inside double-quoted string

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/movie_log.py`

### Vocabulary Introduced
- (none new)

### What He Struggled With
- `f.write()` takes one string argument — passed comma-separated pieces instead of concatenating
- `return load_movies` instead of `return loaded_movies` — returned the function, not the variable
- `os.path.exists` block floating outside any function — structural placement error, caught on review
- Two `with open` blocks inside `load_movies` — redundant, caught on review
- `"title:"` — colon inside the string key instead of as dict separator
- Rating as MPAA string ("R"/"G") instead of float

### What Felt Solid
- `lines = f.readlines()` explained correctly: "a list of strings, 1 for each line"
- Round-trip concept articulated well at session end
- `result` catches what `return` hands back — explained correctly unprompted
- `key not in dict` pattern explained correctly when asked

### Where to Start Next Session
- Placement weak spot: streak still 0 — `os.path.exists` block outside function, caught on review
- Next: BUILD v0.2 — add save on quit and load on startup to `expense_tracker.py`, plus `try/except` on amount input

---

## Session 23 — 2026-06-23

### What We Covered
- Warm-up REPL drill: `try/except` + the `int("50.99")` trap (strings don't truncate — `int(float("50.99"))` does)
- BUILD v0.2 of expense tracker — completed: load on startup, save on quit, error handling on amount
- Split the crammed one-line `.append()` into separate variables so only `amount` sits in `try`
- `continue` to bounce bad input back to the menu (refresher REPL drill)
- Diagnosed a "works the second time" ghost: bad line in `expenses.txt`, masked by `"w"` overwrite on save
- Added `.gitignore` (pycache/.DS_Store/expenses.txt)

### Puzzles Completed
- `projects/expense_tracker.py` (BUILD v0.2)

### Vocabulary Introduced
- (none new)

### What He Struggled With
- Placement: `return loaded_expenses` written INSIDE the for loop — return-inside-loop trap resurfaced (was eliminated S12)
- Placement: `load_expenses()` called inside the while loop, return value discarded — should be once, at startup
- Placement: `save_expenses()` called with no argument, and at first placed where `break` skipped it
- `with ("expenses.txt", "w")` — dropped the `open`; `open(expenses.txt...)` — variable instead of string; `"w"` mode to read

### What Felt Solid
- Separated the three inputs and wrapped only `amount` in try/except — right instinct, did it first try
- `continue` predicted correctly in drill and applied cleanly (last line of except, skips the append)
- Explained load-before-loop / save-after-loop plainly, incl. what breaks if swapped
- Flagged the "it works now for no reason" feeling instead of moving on — good debugging instinct
- Read toward the traceback when pushed (though grabbed the wrong line first)

### Where to Start Next Session
- Placement weak spot: streak still 0 — multiple placement misses again this session
- Return-inside-loop RESURFACED — back on active list, watch it next build
- Count now 3 of 5 → open next session with a targeted placement drill before new content
- Next: Stretch items on expense tracker (delete by number / filter / sort), or start the next roadmap

---

## Session 24 — 2026-06-25

### What We Covered
- Warm-up placement drill: `return` inside a for loop — predicted output of a summing function (caught the trap after one nudge)
- REPL drill: `.pop(index)` — returns the *item* removed, not the index; deletes in place
- Stretch feature: Delete an expense by number — new `elif`, `print_list()` reuse, `pop(n - 1)` bridge
- Off-by-one bridge: user types `1` (1-based display) → `expenses.pop(n - 1)` (0-based list)
- Diagnosed the real bug himself: deletes "not saving" because hard-close skipped `break`, so the after-loop `save_expenses` never ran
- Fix: saving-on-write — call `save_expenses(expenses)` inside Add and Delete blocks

### Puzzles Completed
- `projects/expense_tracker.py` (BUILD — Delete feature + save-on-write)

### Vocabulary Introduced
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), saving-on-write

### What He Struggled With
- Guessed at the bug 3× ("not saving", "global doesn't work", "save the return") before running the app — theorized instead of observing
- "Reaching for a global to read it doesn't work" — wrong; reading a global inside a function is fine, only reassigning is the trap
- Confused pop's return (the item) with the index argument
- Explain-back: knew the fix but struggled to articulate the placement/timing *concept* (needed scaffolding)

### What Felt Solid
- Placement CLEAN and unprompted: new `elif`, both `save_expenses` calls, `pop` not trapped in a loop
- Reached for DRY unprompted — built `print_list()`, then cleaned View All to call it
- Self-diagnosed the hard-close-skips-save bug and proposed save-on-write himself

### Where to Start Next Session
- Placement: 1 clean build appearance this session (streak 0 → 1) — needs 1 more clean unprompted appearance to re-eliminate
- Reinforce debugging discipline: RUN it before theorizing (recurring pattern this session)
- Next: more stretch (filter by category / sort by amount), or start the next roadmap (Pygame/Tkinter)

## Session 25 — 2026-06-26

### What We Covered
- Opener placement drill: `return` inside a for loop — predicted `10` and named the fix correctly (drill, not build)
- Decided next roadmap: rebuild Expense Tracker as a **GUI app** with **CustomTkinter** (modern look). Archived CLI roadmap → `roadmaps/ROADMAP_expense_tracker_cli.md`
- Step 1: installed customtkinter via `python3 -m pip`; built first window (CTk, title, geometry, mainloop)
- Discussed "multiple Pythons" (why `python3 -m pip`) and dependencies (darkdetect/packaging pulled in)
- Step 2: widgets — `CTkLabel`, `CTkButton`, `.pack()`; naming convention `CTk` + widget
- Taught self-discovery: `dir(customtkinter)`, `help()`, official docs
- Step 3: layout — `.grid(row, column)`, row=down/column=right, no pack/grid mixing

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/my_first_window.py` (GUI Steps 1–2: window + label + button)
- `puzzles/layout_practice.py` (GUI Step 3: grid layout)

### Vocabulary Introduced
- library/package, third-party package, pip, dependency, GUI, event-driven programming, event loop / mainloop, widget, geometry manager, callback (named, not yet used)

### What He Struggled With
- Placement: stuffed widget lines INSIDE `mainloop()`'s parentheses — needed structural prompting to fix (not clean)
- row vs column swapped twice — fixed after a drawn grid scaffold
- Explain-back again needed scaffolding to get crisp (consistent pattern)

### What Felt Solid
- Strong analogical transfer: mapped grid/divs from CSS; intuited frames=divs before being taught
- Asked "where do I learn what that means" → then used `CTkEntry` unprompted via discovery
- Fixed the mainloop placement himself once pointed at the structure; described the event loop correctly

### Where to Start Next Session
- Step 4: callbacks (`command=`) — THE core event-driven concept; he already described it in explain-back
- Placement weak spot: appeared in build (widgets in mainloop), needed prompting → streak reset to 0
- Keep one puzzle per file (drifted into reusing my_first_window.py mid-session)

## Session 26 — 2026-06-27

### What We Covered
- Opener: dict/list access from memory — wrote `totals[e["category"]] = totals[e["category"]] + e["amount"]` COLD, no peeking (the fluency gap is closing)
- REPL drill: function name vs call — `say_hi` (object) vs `say_hi()` (runs) vs storing `x = say_hi` then `x()`
- Step 4 — callbacks: `command=on_click` (no parens = pass the function as a value, called later on click)
- `.configure(text=...)` to update a widget after creation; `global count` in a callback (scope trap → UnboundLocalError)
- Debugging: a crashing callback leaves the window running but prints the error to the TERMINAL — caught `NameError` (counter vs count) by looking there
- Step 5 — entry input: `CTkEntry`, `.get()` reads typed text as a string; greet via f-string in a label

### Puzzles Completed
- `puzzles/click_counter.py` (GUI Step 4: callback increments a label)
- `puzzles/greeter_gui.py` (GUI Step 5: entry → .get() → f-string greeting)

### Vocabulary Introduced
- callback (now used, not just named)

### What He Struggled With
- Confused creating a widget with reading one — callback made a NEW empty CTkEntry then `.get()` on it (always empty); also a duplicate stray entry
- Widget-vs-value: tried `name = name.get()`, clobbering the widget + re-triggering the scope trap
- Froze on writing the f-string into `.configure(text=...)` despite knowing f-strings
- Explain-back: said callback "stores the entry" — meant the TEXT from `.get()`, not the widget

### What Felt Solid
- Dict-access line written cold from memory — fluency gap nearly closed
- Function name-vs-call drill: all three predictions right
- Named the scope fix (`global count`) and the no-parens reason unprompted
- Observed on his own that the GUI runs from the terminal and `print()` lands there

### Where to Start Next Session
- Step 6: updating the display dynamically (`.configure`, building output strings) — last step before BUILD v0.1
- Placement: clean & unprompted both puzzles this session (widgets before mainloop, mainloop last) → streak 0 → 1
- Reinforce widget (the box) vs value (the string from `.get()`) — surfaced twice today
- Keep nudging: RUN and read the terminal before theorizing (paid off catching the NameError)
